            <p>Fannie Lou Hamer was a champion of the Civil Rights movement. She was elected Vice-Chair of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964 to represent the black democratic voters of her state. At the Democratic National Convention, challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson who sought to be nominated again for the Democratic ticket.</p>
            <p>Hamer recounted the problems she faced as a black women in Mississippi when asked to speak during the convention. Near tears, Fannie Lou Hamer said:</p>
            <blockquote>All of this is on account we want to register [sic], to become first-class citizens, and if the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now, I question America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings â€” in America?</blockquote>
            <p>Despite attempts by President Johnson to bury her testimony on live television, Hamer's message reached the American people and she became a hero within the Civil Rights movement.
